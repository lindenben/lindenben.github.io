<h2>1. Side projects.</h2>
<h3>Football Statistics Collection</h3>
<p>In this project I have built a script to scrape the commentary feed from football matches and produce statistics by recognising specific words from the feed. An example of the output plot is seen below and the code can be found <a href="URL HERE">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Spatial Analysis</h3>
<p>I have collected publicly available data in order to explore features of cities including Edinburgh and parts of London. The code can be found <a href="lindenben.github.io/notebooks/cities.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>London Underground Delays</h3>
<p>Using data obtained from a FOI request, I analysed the delay times on the London Underground Tube network in 2017. The code can be found <a href="lindenben.github.io/notebooks/tfldelays.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Muse EDA</h3>
<p>Inspired by a post by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/xvivancos/eda-the-cure-discography">Xavier Vivancos Garc√≠a</a> I used the Spotifyr plugin to explore the data held on the Muse discography using the Spotify API. The code can be found <a href="lindenben.github.io/notebooks/musedisco.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>2. Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp with R.</h2>

<h3>Data Visualisation Project </h3>
<p> As part of this project I recreated a visualisation of 'World Corruption and Human Development' that was originally published in The Economist. The code can be found <a href="lindenben.github.io/notebooks/datavisproject.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>3. SQL for Data Science</h2>
<p>I completed an online SQL for Data Science course offered by the <i>University of California, Davis</i> to improve my knowledge of programming languages within the field of data science & analytics. My certificate of completion can be found <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/LCUBDEB6ULZH">here</a>.</p>

<h2>4. Masters Dissertation</h2>
<p>For my dissertation towards my Civil & Structural Engineering masters I undertook a multivariate analysis of self-compacting concrete. This involved all stages of model building from data collection and cleaning to dimension reduction (PCA) and model creation. The work was published at the Ibero-American Congress of Self-compact Concrete and Special Concrete and the paper can be viewed <a href="http://ocs.editorial.upv.es/index.php/HAC-BAC/HAC2018/schedConf/presentations">here</a>.</p>

<h2>5. Talks Attended</h2>
<p> I have attended the following talks which are relevant to the field and have allowed me to stay up to date with the latest analytical techniques.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/improving-in-analytics-tickets-50331530964">Improving in Analytics</a> - 10/10/18</h3>
<p><i>"In our latest 'Get More From Data' event, we'll be discussing the use of data in a variety of sectors from Sport and Business as well as looking both forward to the future of analytics and back to the past to discuss what's changed but also the key traits of a good analyst which will remain the same regardless of technology."</i></p>
