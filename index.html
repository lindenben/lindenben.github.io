<title>Data Analysis portfolio by Ben Linden | LindenBen.github.io</title>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This portfolio is a series of notebooks from my own projects undertaken in my spare time and as part of courses that I've studied.</p>

<h2>Side projects.</h2>
<h3>Football Statistics Collection</h3>
<p>In this project I have built a script to scrape the commentary feed from football matches and produce statistics by recognising specific words from the feed. An example of the output plot is seen below and the code can be found <a href="URL HERE">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Muse EDA</h3>
<p>Inspired by a post by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/xvivancos/eda-the-cure-discography">Xavier Vivancos Garc√≠a</a> I used the Spotifyr plugin to explore the data held on the Muse discography using the Spotify API. The code can be found <a href="lindenben.github.io/notebooks/musedisco.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>London Underground Delays</h3>
<p>Using data obtained from a FOI request, I analysed the delay times on the London Underground Tube network in 2017. The code can be found <a href="URL HERE">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp with R.</h2>

<h3>Data Visualisation Project </h3>
<p> As part of this project I recreated a visualisation of 'World Corruption and Human Development' that was originally published in The Economist. The code can be found <a href="lindenben.github.io/notebooks/datavisproject.html">here</a>.</p>
