<h2>Side projects.</h2>
<h3>Football Statistics Collection</h3>
<p>In this project I have built a script to scrape the commentary feed from football matches and produce statistics by recognising specific words from the feed. An example of the output plot is seen below and the code can be found <a href="URL HERE">here</a>.</p>

<h3>London Underground Delays</h3>
<p>Using data obtained from a FOI request, I analysed the delay times on the London Underground Tube network in 2017. The code can be found <a href="lindenben.github.io/notebooks/tfldelays.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Muse EDA</h3>
<p>Inspired by a post by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/xvivancos/eda-the-cure-discography">Xavier Vivancos Garc√≠a</a> I used the Spotifyr plugin to explore the data held on the Muse discography using the Spotify API. The code can be found <a href="lindenben.github.io/notebooks/musedisco.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp with R.</h2>

<h3>Data Visualisation Project </h3>
<p> As part of this project I recreated a visualisation of 'World Corruption and Human Development' that was originally published in The Economist. The code can be found <a href="lindenben.github.io/notebooks/datavisproject.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Masters Dissertation</h2>
<p>For my dissertation towards my Civil & Structural Engineering masters I undertook a multivariate analysis of self-compacting concrete. This involved all stages of model building from data collection and cleaning to dimension reduction (PCA) and model creation. The work was published at the Ibero-American Congress of Self-compact Concrete and Special Concrete and the paper can be viewed <a href="http://ocs.editorial.upv.es/index.php/HAC-BAC/HAC2018/schedConf/presentations">here</a>.</p>
